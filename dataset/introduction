There are total seven datasets public here, and BTest consists of BTest-1 and BTest-2:

==For Document Classification==
PTr: training dataset for pornographic website;
PTest: testing dataset for pornographic website;
GTr: training dataset for gambling website;
GTest: testing dataset for gambling website;
BTr: training dataset for benign website;
BTest: testing dataset for benign website.

For each dataset above, to make harmful information invisible and commercial protection, we anonymise datasets and give examples to make explanations:
"dn_0,dt_0,[t_0,t_1,t_2]"
"dn_0,dt_1,[t_0,t_1]"
where, 
dn_0: the first website domain in the given dataset;
dt_0 and dt_1: the first and second HTML document of dn_0;
t_0, t_1, t_2: the 1st, 2nd and 3rd term extracted from corresponding HTML document.

==For Fake-Normal Detection==
edge_domain_HP.txt: edges list of domain and hyperlink domain;
edge_domain_IMG.txt: edges list of domain and image link;
edge_domain_TM.txt: edges list of domain and key words in <title>/<meta>;
edge_domain_TV.txt: edges list of domain and tag vector;
edge_domain_EMAIL.txt: edges list of domain and email;
edge_domain_KEY.txt: edges list of domain and third-party KeyID;
edge_domain_dnsA.txt: edges list of domain and reverse IP address;

For each dataset above, to make harmful information invisible and commercial protection, we anonymise datasets and give examples to make explanations:
"domain_0,hp_0,2"
where, 
domain_0: the first website domain in the given dataset;
hp_0: the first hyperlink in the given dataset;
2: weight, how many times domain_0 and hp_0 being connected in the given dataset.
