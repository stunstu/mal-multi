For each dataset, to make harmful information invisible and commercial protection, we anonymise datasets and give examples to make explanations:
"dn_0,dt_0,[t_0,t_1,t_2]"
"dn_0,dt_1,[t_0,t_1]"
where, 
dn_0: the first website domain in the given dataset;
dt_0 and dt_1: the first and second HTML document of dn_0;
t_0, t_1, t_2: the 1st, 2nd and 3rd term extracted from corresponding HTML document.
